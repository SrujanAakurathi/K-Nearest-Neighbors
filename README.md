<b>Problem Statement</b>

An Automotive service chain is launching its new grand service station this weekend. 
They offer to service a wide variety of cars. 
The current capacity of the station is to check 315 cars thoroughly per day. 
As an inaugural offer, they claim to freely check
all cars that arrive on their launch day, and report whether they need servicing or not
Unexpectedly, they get 450 cars. The service men won't work longer than working hours but 
the data analysts have to! Can you save the day for the new service station?




<b>Solution</b>

He has given a dataset which contains some attributes of car taht can be easily measured 
and won't require much time and a conclusion that if service is needed for that or not - <b>"serviceTrainData.csv"</b>
Now for the cars they can't check in detail, they measure those attribute - <b>"serviceTestData.csv"</b>

Use <b>kNN classification</b> technique to classify the cars they can't test manually and say whether service
is needed or not
